# Introduction

%% An introduction deals with the subject of the book, supplementing and introducing the text and indicating a point of view to be adopted by the reader. The introduction usually forms a part of the text [and the text numbering system]; the preface does not." (In other words, the Arabic numbering of the book (1,2,3) starts with the introduction, if there is one. The other front matter takes i, ii, iii, etc.)







Cloud Security - Quick Reference addresses the issues that I have had most commonly with Cloud environments requiring a decent level of security.

This book is laid out by using each step of the Sensible Security Model (SSM) as a chapter.

[**Asset Identification**](#asset-identification) discusses some common assets you may have that you need to think about in terms of what happens if/when an attacker compromises them.

[**Identify Risks**](#identify-risks) works through a collection of risks to your Cloud environment that you will probably be facing.

We then take these risks and discuss possible [**Countermeasures**](#countermeasures) in the following chapter.

Following the Countermeasures chapter is the [**Risks that Solution Causes**](#risks-that-solution-causes) chapter which take the countermeasures and address the possible solution risks, followed by the [**Costs and Trade-offs**](#costs-and-trade-offs) chapter which addresses the potential costs and trade-offs.

Each chapter takes the same issues and addresses them in terms of the current threat modelling stage. Because of this, you may find your self jumping between chapters a bit.


I hope this book serves you well in providing the knowledge you will need to harden your Cloud environments along with a good understanding of how to apply the Sensible Security Model to the same.
