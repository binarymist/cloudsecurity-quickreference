# Preface

%% A preface or foreword deals with the genesis, purpose, limitations, and scope of the book and may include acknowledgements of indebtedness.

## Description

As with my book series [Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers](www.holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com) I have used bruce schneier’s Sensible Security Model (SSM) as we threat model the Cloud environment. You are encouraged to draw parallels between the structure I have created and the Cloud environment you are working on.

With this book I’ve focussed on identifying and addressing the assets, risks, countermeasures, risks that the countermeasures may introduce, and the costs and trade-offs that I frequently encounter working with organisations and their Development Teams.

This book is targeted towards helping Architects and Software Engineers in a hurry.

## Purpose

My intention with this book is for it to serve as a reference to help you recognise your assets, your attackers, and understand both your CSPs responsibilities and your own responsibilities in terms of securing your Cloud environment. I will also discuss many risks that I've seen, and address them with potential countermeasures with the goal of designing and implementing a Cloud environment that will withstand the attacks from your adversaries. At the same time not getting bogged down in hundreds of pages of content.

## Reason

The content of this book forms part of the much larger book, namely Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers Fascicle 1. It came to my attention that many people currently working with their Cloud environment, only needed or wanted what was immediately relevant to them now. This encouraged me to break out the chapter on Cloud security into it's own book, so that it could have a life of it's own helping those deeply invested in the Cloud.
